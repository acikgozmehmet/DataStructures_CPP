## General info
Projects on basic data structures such as queues, stacks, trees, dictionaries, their
associated operations, and their array and pointer implementations
are stored. Topics also include recursion, templates, fundamental
algorithm analysis, searching, sorting, hashing, object-oriented
concepts and large program organization.
